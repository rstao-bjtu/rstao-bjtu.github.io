I am an Associate Professor at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.bjtu.edu.cn), [BJTU](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn), working in collaboration with Prof. [Yao Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=474TbQYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (IEEE Fellow). I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from [BUAA](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2017 and 2022, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Wei Li (Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). Previously, I was a Senior Researcher at Noahâ€™s Ark Lab, Huawei, collaborating with Dr. [Yunhe Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=isizOkYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My research focuses on two major directions: AI Robustness and Generalization and Vision-Language Models and Benchmarking. The first direction encompasses AI Safety and Security, including Digital Image Content Forensics, DeepFake Detection, and Forensic Watermarking, as well as Open-world Learning, which aims to improve machine learning adaptability in real-world scenarios through Open-set Learning, Domain Adaptation, and Few-shot Learning. The second direction focuses on Vision-Language Models, leveraging large-scale pre-training approaches like CLIP and ALIGN to enhance cross-modal understanding, alongside Evaluation Benchmarking, where I develop rigorous assessments for critical yet underexplored areas to advance research and innovation.

[Prospective students] Our group (BJTU) has positions for PhD students, Master students, and visiting students. If you are interested, please feel free to send me an email with your CV and publications (if any).
